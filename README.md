# Heart-disease-prediction
Machine learning model
The project aims to develop a predictive model for heart disease using machine learning techniques. Leveraging a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, the project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model development. Key steps include handling missing values, detecting and addressing outliers, visualizing data distributions, and analyzing feature correlations. Three classification models—Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest—are compared and evaluated based on performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The logistic regression model, chosen for its high accuracy and balanced performance, is trained and deployed using Streamlit, enabling users to input clinical parameters and obtain predictions regarding heart disease risk. The project's goal is to provide a practical and accessible tool for healthcare professionals and individuals to assess and manage heart disease risks effectively. The code and findings are documented in this repository, facilitating transparency, reproducibility, and further exploration.
